/*
 *  Crown's masternode staking consensus layer use a "staking node proof pointer" that will point to a recent
 *  masternode reward that node has received. If the reward is recent enough, and the coins used as collateral for the
 *  masternode have not yet been spent, it can reasonably be assumed that this node is a valid masternode or at least
 *  has been a valid masternode within the recent past.
 *
 * @param hashBlock The blockhash that recently paid this masternode
 * @param txid The transaction ID within the block that paid the masternode
 * @param nPos The position within the transaction output vector that paid the masternode
 * @param pubkeyCollateral The masternode's public key that holds it's masternode collateral coins (masternode.pubkey)
 * @param pubKeyProofOfStake A public key that has permission granted from the pubkeyCollateral to create blocks for that masternode
 * @param vchSigCollateralSignOver Signature that grants permission from pubkeyCollateral to pubkeyProofOfStake
